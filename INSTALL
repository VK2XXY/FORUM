 You'll need working Mysql database and PHP3-enabled Apache to get it working.

Part 1:   Forum installation

1. Unpack forum-x.x.tgz :
    gzip -d -c | tar xf -
    
2. Edit setup.php3 and setup variables for mysql database,user,password and
   table name. Mysql table will be autocreated.
   Mysql table description is located in forum.sql

3. Open in browser http://your.site.com/cool_forum/ to view forum.
4. Open  http://your.site.com/cool_forum/admin.php3 for administration. 
   If you don't setup apache authentication for this file (and for the 
   stats.php3) you'll have to set username and password in setup.php3.
5. SECURITY is on your own task.

Part 2:   Customizing forum

1. Edit options in setup.php3.
2. Edit header.inc and footer.inc - for main forum page.
3. Edit short_header.inc and short_footer.inc - for 'read message' page,
   admin page, and search page.
4. You can also change images in img/ subdirectory. See img/README file.
5. Edit source code of forum and contribute changes to authors :))
